# Implementation of Latency Aware Rate Adaptation for 802.11n in NS-3

# Course Code: CS821

## Overview

LLRA is a latency-aware rate adaptation scheme that reduces the tail latency for delay-sensitive applications. Most of the Rate Adaptation Algorithm till now focuses mainly on the throughput of 802.11 networks. The main focus of this algorithm[1] is to reduce the tail latency by optimising the design of rate control, frame aggregation scheduling, transmission dispatching. This repository provides Implementation of Latency Aware Rate Adaption for 802.11n in NS-3[2]
